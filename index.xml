&lt;p>My name is Rui GonÃ§alo, I work as a Senior SOC Analyst for Kaspersky Lab. I decided to create this blog to share stuff I learned and worked on my own time. I always find that I also learn better when I&amp;rsquo;m explaining to someone else so this blog is also for me. I will write mostly about infosec areas, such as &lt;strong>Malware, Threat Intel and Digital Forensics&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will always try to publish articles with good detail, since I always like to follow the chain, without going too deep down in the rabbit hole.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
