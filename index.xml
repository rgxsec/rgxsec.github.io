&lt;p>My name is Rui GonÃ§alo, I work as a Senior SOC Analyst for Kaspersky Lab. I decided to create this blog to share stuff I learned and worked on my own time. I always find that I also learn better when I&amp;rsquo;m explaining to someone else so this blog is also for me. I will write mostly about infosec areas, such as &lt;strong>Cloud, Malware, Threat Intel and Forensics&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>All information and opinions shared on this blog, are my own not my employer&lt;/strong>, as well as all text you will read is written by me, &lt;strong>I will only be using AI for task assistance&lt;/strong> such as coding and other stuff like cool images from anime or video games I played as a kid.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
