&lt;h3 id="objective">Objective&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The objective is to create a &lt;strong>Terraform config file&lt;/strong> with &lt;strong>insecure&lt;/strong> configs on purpose. Test code security scanning tools, such as &lt;strong>checkov&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>tfsec&lt;/strong> and then in a part 2 in the comming future, hopefully ;) time is an elusive thing, automate the process using CI\CD pipelines, something like &lt;strong>Github actions&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://rgxsec.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 13:52:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rgxsec.github.io/about/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="whoami">&lt;code>$whoami&lt;/code>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My name is Rui G., I work in InfoSec, my daily activities include malware analysis, cloud security, threat detection &amp;amp; hunting. I decided to create this blog to share stuff I learned and that I work on my own time. I always find that I learn better when I&amp;rsquo;m explaining to someone else, so this blog is also selfishly for me. I will write mostly about InfoSec areas, focusing on stuff about &lt;strong>Cloud, Malware, Threat Intel and Forensics&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
