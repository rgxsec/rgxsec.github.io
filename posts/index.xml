&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by its name, the text in Rich Text Format (RTF) documents isn&amp;rsquo;t gold plated or bathed in some kind of rare mineral pool (I know. lame ass joke &amp;ndash; get used to it). The purpose of its origin was to serve as a cross-platform text format between Macintosh and Windows systems, and was developed by Microsoft in 1987.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IaC automated code security scanning via CI/CD pipeline - part 1</title><link>https://rgxsec.github.io/posts/iaccodesecscan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 10:10:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rgxsec.github.io/posts/iaccodesecscan/</guid><description>&lt;p>I decided to create this post since I was looking to cloud in a security perspective and noticed this would be a fun thing to try and get hands-on experience in CI\CD and the magical activity of Terraforming, uh seems so cool and wizardy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="objective">Objective&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The objective is to create a &lt;strong>Terraform config file&lt;/strong> with &lt;strong>insecure&lt;/strong> configs on purpose. Test code security scanning tools, such as &lt;strong>checkov&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>tfsec&lt;/strong> and then in a part 2 in the comming future, hopefully ;) time is an elusive thing, automate the process using CI\CD pipelines, something like &lt;strong>Github actions&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
